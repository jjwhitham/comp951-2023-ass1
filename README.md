## Datasets
1. Create a directory called `datasets` under your project directory and unzip the datasets there
2. Run `python -m test_ass1` at the top of the project directory to check if any of the datasets have been modified
    * NB: Mac/Linux uses the 'LF' character as a line ending, however, Windows uses 'CRLF'. This might cause the test to fail. If so, we'll update the test
